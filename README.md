This project teaches how to create our own functions.
While learning to do this, I learned new keywords and concepts such as 
def, if, else, return, True, False, importing modules with import math, using math.sqrt and math.gcd, and writing docstrings. 
The most difficult function for me to create was the quadratic_function.
